# FMAR Design Artefacts Repository

**Welcome to the official design artefact repository for the Flexibility Market Asset Registration (FMAR) Programme, managed by Elexon as the GB Market Facilitator.**


## 1. How to Engage with This Repository

We actively encourage participation from all industry stakeholders. Your expertise is crucial to our success.

*   **To Review Artefacts:** All published design documentation can be found within the repository's directory structure. We recommend starting with the `00-Programme-Level` and `01-Ecosystem-Architecture` folders to read the detailed descriptions of the core user journeys and functionalities FMAR will support.

Use the table of contents below to navigate through the different architectural domains and artefacts.
