# FMAR Design Artefacts Repository

**Welcome to the official design artefact repository for the Flexibility Market Asset Register (FMAR) Programme, managed by Elexon as the designated GB Market Facilitator.**

## 1. Purpose of This Repository

This repository serves as the **single source of truth** for all public-facing design artefacts related to the FMAR programme. It is a central collaboration space for Elexon's FMAR Architecture Team and our valued industry stakeholders to engage in an open, iterative, and transparent design process.

Our primary goal is to co-design a robust and future-proof FMAR system that will:
*   **Simplify asset registration** with a "register once, use many times" capability.
*   **Lower barriers to entry** for flexibility providers.
*   **Enhance visibility and data quality** for System Operators.
*   **Provide a foundational digital infrastructure** to support an efficient, competitive, and decarbonized GB energy system.

## 2. How to Engage with This Repository

We actively encourage participation from all industry stakeholders. Your expertise is crucial to our success.

*   **To Review Artefacts:** All published design documents can be found within the repository's directory structure. We recommend starting with the `00-Programme-Level` and `01-Ecosystem-Architecture` folders.
*   **To Provide Feedback or Ask Questions:** The primary method for providing input is by raising a question in **[GitHub Discussions]**(https://github.com/mez-FMDA/MF.github.io/discussions/categories/general-discussion) or by creating a **[GitHub Issue](https://github.com/elexon/fmar-design-artefacts/issues)**. Please use the available templates to ensure your feedback is structured and can be effectively triaged by our team.
*   **To Track Progress:** You can "Watch" this repository to receive notifications on new Issues, discussions, and artefact updates. Progress on key design themes is also tracked on our **[FMAR Design Project Board]**(link-to-your-github-project-board)**.

**Please Note:** Only authorized members of the FMAR Architecture Team can commit changes and merge pull requests to the main branches of this repository to ensure quality and control. All industry feedback provided via Issues will be reviewed, and if accepted, incorporated into subsequent versions of the artefacts by the team.

## 3. Programme Vision & Key Documents

Our design process is guided by a long-term strategic vision for FMAR as a hub of logically distinct, centrally managed data modules.

*   **[FMAR Programme: Vision & Scope (v0.1)](https://github.com/mez-FMDA/MF.github.io/blob/main/docs/Market_Facilitator/FMAR_Design/Programme_Level/FMAR_Design_Project_Overview.md)**: A high-level overview of the FMAR Hub, its objectives, and the phased approach (MVP and beyond). **This is the best place to start.**
*   **[Ecosystem Use Case Catalogue](https://github.com/mez-FMDA/MF.github.io/tree/main/docs/Market_Facilitator/FMAR_Design/Ecosystem_Architecture/User_Case_Catalogue)**: Detailed descriptions of the core user journeys and functionalities FMAR will support.
*   **[FMAR Common Glossary & Ontology Principles](https://github.com/mez-FMDA/MF.github.io/blob/main/docs/Market_Facilitator/FMAR_Design/Programme_Level/Glossary.md)**: Definitions for key terms used across the FMAR ecosystem to ensure a shared understanding.
*   **[Key Support Artefacts](https://github.com/mez-FMDA/MF.github.io/tree/main/docs/Market_Facilitator/FMAR_Design/Supporting_Artefacts)**: Outlines our alignment with critical industry initiatives, including:
    *   ENA Open Networks - GB Profile Dispatch API
    *   Data Sharing Infrastructure (DSI)
    *   Consumer Consent
