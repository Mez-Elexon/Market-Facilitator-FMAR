# FMAR Design Artefacts Repository

**Welcome to the official design artefact repository for the Flexibility Market Asset Registration (FMAR) Programme, managed by Elexon as the GB Market Facilitator.**


## 1. How to Engage with This Repository

We actively encourage participation from all industry stakeholders. Your expertise is crucial to our success.

*   **To Review Artefacts:** All published design documentation can be indexed in the table of contents below. We recommend starting with the `00-Programme-Level` and `01-Ecosystem-Architecture` folders to read the latest understanding of the descriptions of the core user journeys and functionalities FMAR will support.

The table of contents below is structured by way of the different architectural domains and artefacts that will be in scope of Elexon's High Level Design consultation in Winter 2025/2026.
