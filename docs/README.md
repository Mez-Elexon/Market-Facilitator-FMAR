## 1. Purpose of This Repository

This repository serves as the **single source of truth** for all public-facing design artefacts related to the FMAR programme. It is a central collaboration space for Elexon's FMAR Architecture Team and our valued industry stakeholders to engage in an open, iterative, and transparent design process.

Our primary goal is to co-design a robust and future-proof FMAR system that will:
*   **Simplify asset registration** with a "register once, use many times" capability, initially focusing data collection at the 'point of market entry'.
*   **Lower barriers to entry** for flexibility providers by managing the lifecycle of asset and flexibility service data (data related to a counterparty and their contract with the asset owner).
*   **Enhance visibility and data quality** for System Operators who will require improvements to operational visibility in a high- DER and CER system.
*   **Provide a public interest digital asset** that supports an efficient, competitive, and decarbonised GB energy system.

Our design process is guided by a long-term strategic vision for FMAR as as a public interest digital asset, guided by Ofgem's Flexibility Digital Infrastructure workstream.
