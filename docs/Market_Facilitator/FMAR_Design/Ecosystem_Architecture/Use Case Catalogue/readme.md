Notes:
>Sequence Diagrams: For more complex use cases (like Qualify Market Unit), a simple sequence diagram could be included as a visual aid in the repository, showing the interactions between Actors and FMAR Modules.<br><br>
>Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs): A separate section or document in the repository could detail the NFRs (e.g., performance, scalability, availability) for each use case. For example, "Register Asset" needs to support a high volume of transactions, while "Register Service Provider" has a much lower volume.<br><br>
>Edge Cases / Exceptions: While the snappy format is good, a "Key Considerations" or "Exceptions" field for each use case is valuable to capture complexities. I've added a "Key Considerations" field to the examples above.<br><br>
>Data Attributes: While the use case itself doesn't list every data field, a link to the relevant part of the FMAR Common Ontology or data model for that use case would be extremely useful for developers. For example, in UC-02.02 Register Asset, you could link to the "Core Asset" entity in your data model.<br><br>
Given the socio-political-economic dimensions, the technical artefacts (BDAT) are only half the story. To ensure this national infrastructure is successful, the following non-technical artefacts are critical to produce during the design stage:
<br><br>FMAR Governance Framework:
Content: This document goes beyond the internal Elexon governance. It should define the industry-wide governance model for FMAR. Who gets a say in future changes? What is the formal process for evolving the FMAR Common Ontology or adding new Asset Categories? It must define the roles and responsibilities of the FMAR Industry Insights Design Group and Industry Experts Committee, and how their advice translates into decisions.
Why it's important: This builds industry trust and buy-in by making the "rules of the game" transparent. It manages the political dimension of who controls this critical national asset.
<br><br>FMAR Operating Model & Service Level Agreement (SLA) (Draft):
Content: Defines the service FMAR will provide. What are the target uptime/availability? What are the support hours and processes for users? What are the timelines for key processes (e.g., "FSP registration will be processed within X business days")?
Why it's important: This manages industry expectations about the quality and reliability of the service. It's a key economic artefact that allows FSPs to plan their business operations around FMAR.
<br><br>FMAR Data Ethics & Privacy Assessment:
Content: A detailed assessment that goes beyond a standard DPIA. It should explicitly address the ethical considerations of creating a central asset register. How will data be used to ensure fair market access for small players? How will consumer privacy be protected by design? What are the principles for data anonymization in reporting?
Why it's important: This directly addresses the socio-political concerns around a "big brother" database of energy assets, building trust with consumers and the public.
<br><br>FMAR Stakeholder Engagement & Communications Plan:
Content: A detailed plan for how the programme will communicate with different stakeholder groups throughout the design, build, and implementation phases. It should define key messages, channels, and feedback mechanisms.
Why it's important: This ensures that industry is carried along on the journey, understands the benefits ("how you will feel a difference"), and knows how and when to get involved. It mitigates the risk of industry resistance due to poor communication.
<br><br>FMAR Benefits Realisation Plan:
Content: This document should quantify the expected benefits of FMAR (e.g., reduced admin costs for FSPs, improved network planning efficiency for SOs, lower costs for consumers). It should define how these benefits will be measured and tracked post-go-live.
Why it's important: This provides the economic justification for the investment in FMAR and creates a framework for holding the programme accountable for delivering its promised value.
Producing these non-technical artefacts in parallel with the technical design is not an optional extra; for an initiative of this national significance, they are essential for managing the complex stakeholder landscape and ensuring long-term success.
