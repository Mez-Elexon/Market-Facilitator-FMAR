| Description      | Onboards a new Flexibility Service Provider (FSP) as a recognised commercial entity within the FMAR ecosystem.                                  |
| Goal             | To create a single, authoritative record for an FSP, which can then be linked to users, assets, and market qualifications.                     |
| Actors           | FSP Administrator.                                                                                                                              |
| Preconditions    | • The FSP must be a valid legal entity (e.g., registered with Companies House). <br> • The FSP must not already be registered in FMAR.         |
| Process Summary  | 1. An FSP's authorised representative initiates registration via the FMAR API/UI. <br> 2. FSP provides its core legal and commercial details. <br> 3. FMAR validates the information (potentially against external sources like Companies House). <br> 4. SPUM creates a unique FMAR FSP ID and a master record for the entity. |
| Postconditions   | • The FSP is registered and active within FMAR. <br> • The FSP can now register its users (UC-01.01) and assets (UC-02.02).                    |
| Dependencies     | • None. This is a primary onboarding step.                                                                                                      |
| Key Considerations | • The process for validating entity authenticity must be robust.                                                                               |
