| Element          | Description                                                                                                                                     |

| Goal             | To facilitate market competition and consumer choice by providing a standardised, low-friction digital process for transferring the commercial responsibility for a Market Unit between FSPs. |
| Actors           | Gaining FSP, Losing FSP, Asset Owner (as the trigger).                                                                                          |
| Preconditions    | • Both the Gaining and Losing FSPs are registered in SPUM. <br> • The Market Unit exists in PSQM and is currently associated with the Losing FSP. <br> • Appropriate authorization for the switch has been obtained from the Asset Owner(s). |
| Process Summary  | 1. The Gaining FSP, with authorisation, initiates a "Switch Market Unit" request via the FMAR API, identifying the Market Unit and the Losing FSP. <br> 2. FMAR notifies the Losing FSP of the pending switch. <br> 3. Following a defined notice period or confirmation, PSQM re-assigns the Market Unit's FSP link from the Losing FSP's record to the Gaining FSP's record in SPUM. <br> 4. All existing valid qualifications for the Market Unit are transferred to the Gaining FSP. |
| Postconditions   | • Commercial responsibility for the Market Unit is successfully transferred to the Gaining FSP. <br> • An auditable record of the switch is created. |
| Dependencies     | • Relies on a clear authorisation process (likely involving the Consumer Consent solution). <br> • Depends on FSP identities managed in SPUM.   |
| Key Considerations | • Clear business rules are needed for handling in-flight contracts or dispatch instructions predicated on the unit qualifications status during a switch. <br> • The process must be secure to prevent unauthorized transfers. |
