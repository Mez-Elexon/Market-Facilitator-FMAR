# Use Case UC-02.02: Register Asset  
**Primary Module:** ARM (supported by SPUM)  

| Element          | Description                                                                                                                           |

| Description      | The primary process for an authorized user to submit data for a new flexible asset, which is then validated and assigned a unique FMAR ID. |
| Goal             | To create a single, authoritative record for a flexible asset that can be used across multiple markets, eliminating re-registration.   |
| Actors           | FSP, Asset Owner (acting via FSP or directly), Independent Market Platform, (Installer ?)                                                                             |
| Preconditions    | • The registering user and their organisation are registered and authenticated via SPUM. <br> • The relevant asset category exists (UC-02.01). |
| Process Summary  | 1. User submits asset data (technical, locational, ownership) via the FMAR API. <br> 2. ARM validates the data against the relevant asset category schema. <br> 3. Upon successful validation, ARM assigns a unique, persistent FMAR Asset ID. <br> 4. The asset record is created and linked to the FSP's record in SPUM. |
| Postconditions   | • A unique, immutable FMAR Asset ID is created. <br> • The asset is registered in ARM and is now discoverable by authorised parties.  |
| Dependencies     | • Requires a valid FSP/User identity from SPUM. <br> • Requires consumer consent to be in place (interfacing with an external consent solution). |
| Key Considerations | • The process must support both single asset registration and bulk uploads.                                                         |
