# FMAR Use Case Catalogue

This document outlines the core use cases for the Flexibility Market Asset Register (FMAR).  

FMAR supports registration, qualification, and data sharing for flexible assets participating in GB flexibility markets.  

It is designed to operate through modular components and may leverage a federated architecture via the Data Sharing Infrastructure (DSI).
